On March 20, the rapper announced the news on Instagram, uploading a couple of photos of his chin injuries and blood on his neck.</p><p>After having a near-death experience in 2022, shortly after being diagnosed with cancer, he urged his supporters to pray for him. The caption says as follows:</p><p>“Please pray for me, family.” I’ve almost died twice already in 2022, and it’s only been three months. Smh, first this cancer S**t, and now this b******t… The s**t is genuine out here, man, so put the weapons down.”<br>He went on to say, “</p><p>“Also, everyone, please move properly and militantly everywhere you go. Be safe, but most importantly, stay dangerous!” I appreciate you everyone keeping my spirits up during these trying times — love trunks.”</p><p>Lil Tracy and Noah Cyrus both questioned whether he was okay after seeing his Instagram post. More information on the event has yet to be released.</p><h2>Who is Kid Trunks?</h2><p><strong>Kid Trunks</strong>, <strong>popularly known as “YoungBoi Trunks,” was born on July 4, 2000</strong>. He rose to prominence with his song Talk and then launched his most popular hit, IDK, which earned over 10 million views on YouTube in just seven months. When he was two years old, the Vietnam native from Ho Chi Minh City moved to the United States with his family. He moved back and forth between Miami and Boston for the following few years until settling in Broward County, Florida.</p><p>Trunks are the youngest of three siblings and were reared in a single-parent family. He was ridiculed and harassed throughout his scholastic years in Florida, where he attended middle and high school. As he hustled with marijuana to aid his single mother, his life was not easy. Because of his terrible behavior at school, he was also transferred to an alternate facility.</p><p>When he was 15, he met XXXTentacion. They became buddies and began to hang together and collaborate on music. Trunks was later introduced to Ski Mask the Slump God by XXXTentacion, who welcomed him into his “Members Only” gang.</p><p>Trunks rose to fame slowly but steadily, finally succumbing to drug addiction. He stated previously that he spent thousands of dollars every week to meet his requirements. After the publication of Talk in 2017, the public became aware of his existence, and his Instagram followers grew. On SoundCloud, the song has earned 5 million plays. In September 2017, he released The Kid Before Trunks, a nine-track first album.</p><p>IDK was his second project, which he launched in April 2018, followed by SS1 and Super Saiyan in the same year. Robb Banks, Suigeneris, Yung Gleesh, and others were among the artists with whom he cooperated.</p><p>The vocalist is now contracted to Empire Distribution and has no record label affiliation. <strong>His net worth is thought to be in the $1 million range</strong> <strong>as of November 2023.</strong>&nbsp;He has not indicated whether he is in a relationship, and no other facts regarding his personal life have been published.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiuoaddnsBut8idZK2qpaO4tHs%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./dig-top-encrypted-cipher-quest.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Fortnite &amp;quot;Dig At the Top of&amp;quot; Encrypted Cipher Quest Guide">&larr;
