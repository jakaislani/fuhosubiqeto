In Los Angeles, Brown will soon debut her first vegan eatery, Kale My Name. Early in 2021, Tabitha saw Kale My Name while they were filming The Chi.</strong></p><p><strong>She proposed to its owner, Nemanja Nekac, that they grow the company. Nemanja consented to turn Brown into a restaurateur by appointing her as a co-owner of the California section of the company. “It’s formally taking place!” Shared by Tabitha on Instagram. “My first restaurant will soon be open. I’m appreciative.</strong></p><h2>Tabitha Defended her Marriage</h2><p>Wendy Williams questioned Tabitha’s decision to retire her husband, and Brown defended her marriage.</p><p>On <strong>June 26, 2021</strong>, Tabitha Brown announced on YouTube that Chance Brown had left the police department. She referred to it as the fulfillment of a 15-year dream. Tabitha shared with delight:</p><p><strong>“My husband sincerely believed he could make a difference when he embarked on this adventure, and I am aware that he has in his community. He played his role. But I also realize that he needs to start dreaming once more.</strong></p><p>Wendy Williams, the host of a talk program, didn’t enjoy Brown’s joy. She mentioned her own experience with having a husband retire and said it didn’t go well. Wendy anticipated a scenario in which Chance would hold Brown responsible for his failed investments. William revealed:</p><p><strong>The money is taken or defrauded after they invest in anything else. Once more investing occurs, he returns home and dumps his suitcase on the floor.</strong><br></p><p>And he says,</p><p><strong>“You’re to blame for this; I can’t do it.” You made me quit my work while you were over here getting rich and doing other things.</strong></p><p>Wendy was addressed by Tabitha, who defended her marriage to Chance. Brown expressed sympathy for Wendy’s situation and mentioned that she and Chance had remained married for 23 years despite facing many challenges. Cathy remarked:</p><p><strong>Twenty-three years. I’ve been living with my broke husband for a very long time. struggled side by side for a very long period. has been successful during the past few years. I worked with him every year in the LAPD, and he worked with me every year in the entertainment industry, facing rejection and refusals.</strong></p><p>Brown stated that she remained faithful to her husband because she had given the marriage over to God. Brown said,</p><p><strong>“In our marriage, He [God] comes first. God, not wealth, prosperity, or business. He’s the first,”.</strong></p><p>Tabitha Brown husband had one daughter, Tyleah, before getting into a relationship with Tabitha. Chance Brown and Tabitha Brown have been married for 17 years after beginning their relationship more than 20 years ago. Chance added the following caption on an Instagram photo of the pair on April 19, 2020:</p><p><strong>“22 years together, 17 married years… @iamtabithabrown still has the same expression on her face. I’m incredibly lucky. I give thanks to the Lord for allowing us to develop a close bond and for enabling us to like one another in addition to loving one another.</strong></p><p>Chance was already the father of young Tyleah Brown when he and Tabitha began dating. Since Tyleah is frequently seen in pictures of the Brown family, many people believe she is Tabitha’s biological child. Tyleah is treated as Tabitha’s daughter, and their relationship is evident on social media.</p><p>TV personality Chance Brown and his wife co-host the IGTV program Fridays with Tab and Chance. He has a strong passion for basketball and is a successful businessman. He teaches kids aged 5 to 12 how to develop connections via the principles of basketball through his organization, “Team Chance Basketball.”</p><p>Chance is a devoted husband and father who gives his wife and kids additional support in their attempts. He backed Tabitha’s decision to become vegan by making the same lifestyle change. Chance frequently shares on Instagram the successes of his children. Chance recently shared a video on Instagram with pictures of his family in which he discussed the value of family to him:</p><p><strong>“My family is the most significant aspect of my existence, in my opinion. There isn’t a day that goes by that I don’t consider what I can do, say, learn, etc., as a husband and father, to be a better guy.</strong></p><p>Tabitha Brown’s daughter Choyce is the CEO of an upcoming skincare line and is a social media influencer. The inspiration behind Tabitha’s successful social media career is Choyce Brown.</p><p>She advised her mum to start uploading videos to TikTok in March 2020, and it turned out to be sage advice. The New York Times was told by Choyce that “she picked it up quite swiftly.” I simply believed she would fit well because of how reassuring she is.</p><p>Choyce is a well-known online personality who has more than <strong>300,000 Instagram followers.</strong> In addition to being a model, she will introduce her skincare line, Skinbychoyce, in <strong>2021</strong>.</p><p>Choyce and her brother Question contribute to Tabitha’s material by participating in talks about topics like parenting and helping to produce recipes.</p><p><span style=font-size:18pt>Also Read: <a class=waffle-rich-text-link href=#>Who Is Katie Leung Currently Dating?
