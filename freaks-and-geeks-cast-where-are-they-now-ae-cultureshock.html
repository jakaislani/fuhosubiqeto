Now a cult classic, the early 80s-set show, which aired from 1999-2000, centered on brother and sister Lindsay and Sam Weir along with a crew of misfits battling teenage woes at William McKinley High School.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The series — which consisted of 18 episodes — didn't follow the script of typical teen dramas of the time and took a more true-to-life approach. "My friends and I weren’t popular in high school, we weren’t dating all the time, and we were just trying to get through our lives," series creator Paul Feig explained to Vanity Fair. "I wanted to leave a chronicle — to make people who had gone through it laugh, but also as a primer for kids going in, to say, 'Here’s what you can expect.'"</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Doomed by a difficult time slot and plummeting ratings, Freaks and Geeks still remained a critical success and even won an Emmy for Outstanding Casting in a Comedy Series. So what went wrong? Cast member Seth Rogen had one theory: "You just have to conclude that people would rather watch shirtless dudes get tackled than a TV show about emotional sh*t that’s funny."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">But as the show's theme song from Joan Jett and The Blackhearts suggested, the cast, like their characters, didn't give a damn about their bad reputations. Rogen, along with costars including James Franco and Jason Segel, went on to shoot to superstardom. Here's what they and their other William McKinley High classmates have been up to since NBC canceled the show in 2000.</p><h2 data-node-id=6 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Linda Cardellini (Lindsay Weir)</h2><img alt="Linda Cardellini" title="Linda Cardellini" width=1920 height=1080 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/linda-cardellini_photocredmagdazofia.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j2">Photo: MagdaZofia</span><p>Linda Cardellini</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 2002, Linda Cardellini starred as Velma in the live-action Scooby-Doo films alongside Sarah Michelle Gellar, Freddie Prinze Jr., and Matthew Lillard before joining the cast of ER, playing nurse Samantha Taggart, until the NBC medical drama wrapped in 2009. Also acting in films including Legally Blonde and Brokeback Mountain, Cardellini went on to score an Emmy nom for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Drama Series as Don Draper's love interest Sylvia Rosen in AMC's Mad Men. Most recently she appeared as Meg Rayburn in the three-season family drama Bloodline and as Judy Hale in Dead to Me. After dating Freaks and Geeks costar Jason Segel for five years once the show was canceled, she welcomed a daughter, Lilah-Rose, with childhood friend Steven Rodriguez in 2012, and the pair became engaged in 2013.</p><h2 data-node-id=11 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">John Francis Daley (Sam Weir)</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">John Francis Daley appeared on TV shows including The Geena Davis Show, Boston Public, Regular Joe, and Kitchen Confidential before joining the cast of Fox's Bones in 2007 as psychologist Lance Sweets until his character was killed off in 2014. Daley co-wrote both the 2011 dark comedy Horrible Bosses as well as 2015's Vacation, the latter of which he also co-directed. In 2017, he wrote the screenplay for Spider-Man: Homecoming. He directed the 2018 movie Game Night.

The following year he began playing the Green Goblin's son Harry Osbourne in the Spider-Man movie franchise and went on to appear in two other sequels. Franco appeared several other films including Milk, Eat Pray Love, and Pineapple Express before earning an Academy Award nomination for his role in 2010's 127 Hours. He and Freaks and Geeks costar (and frequent collaborator) Seth Rogen made headlines when their controversial 2014 comedy The Interview (in which the duo was tasked with killing North Korean dictator <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/kim-jong-un data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Kim Jong-un" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Kim Jong-un</a>) led to a real-life North Korean-led cyber attack on Sony Pictures Entertainment. In 2018, Franco won another Best Actor Golden Globe for his role in The Disaster Artist. Even with a successful acting career, beginning in 2006, he enrolled at UCLA, Columbia University, New York University, and Yale University.</p><h2 data-node-id=15 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Samm Levine (Neal Schweiber)</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Samm Levine made his big-screen debut in 2001's spoof film Not Another Teen Movie and went on to appear in other teen-centered films, including I Love You, Beth Cooper.
