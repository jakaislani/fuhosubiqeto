Zamperini competed in the 1936 Berlin Olympics and was set to compete again in the 1940 games in Tokyo, which were canceled when World War II broke out. A bombardier in the Army Air Corps, Zamperini was in a plane that went down, and when he arrived on shore in Japan 47 days later, he was taken as a prisoner of war and tortured for two years. After his release, Zamperini became an inspirational figure, and his life served as the basis for the 2014 biography Unbroken: A World War II Story of Survival, Resilience, and Redemption.</p><h2 data-node-id=3 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Early Years</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Louis Silvie Zamperini was born to Italian immigrant parents on January 26, 1917, in the town of Olean, New York. Growing up in Torrance, California, Zamperini ran track at Torrance High School and discovered that he had a talent for long-distance running.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1934, Zamperini set the national high school mile record, and his time of 4 minutes and 21.2 seconds would stand for an incredible 20 years. His track prowess also caught the attention of the University of Southern California, which he earned a scholarship to attend.</p><h2 data-node-id=7 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">1936 Berlin Olympics</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">It wasn’t long before Zamperini was taking his love of track to the next level, and in 1936 he headed to New York City for the 5,000-meter Olympic trials. Held on Randall’s Island, the race pitted Zamperini against Don Lash, the world record holder in the event. The race ended in a dead heat between the two runners, and the finish was enough to qualify Zamperini for the 1936 Olympics in Berlin, while he was still a teenager.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Zamperini trained for only a few weeks in the 5,000 meters, and although he ran well (he finished his last lap in only 56 seconds), he didn’t medal, coming in eighth (to Lash’s 13th). During the overwhelming pageant that is the Olympics, the 19-year-old stood near <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/adolf-hitler data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Adolf Hitler" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Adolf Hitler</a>’s box with his fellow athletes, seeking a photo of the Nazi leader. Looking back on the event, Zamperini said, “I was pretty naïve about world politics, and I thought he looked funny, like something out of a Laurel and Hardy film.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1938, Zamperini was back setting records at the collegiate level, this time breaking the mile record of 4:08.3, a new mark that held for 15 years. Zamperini graduated from USC in 1940, a year that would have been the speedster’s next shot at Olympic gold, but World War II intervened.</p><h2 data-node-id=11 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">World War II and Japanese POW Camp</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">With the outbreak of World War II, the 1940 Olympics were canceled, and Zamperini enlisted in the Army Air Corps. He ended up a bombardier on the B-24 Liberator, and in May 1943, Zamperini and a crew went out on a flight mission to search for a pilot whose plane had gone down. Out over the Pacific Ocean, Zamperini’s plane suffered mechanical failure and crashed into the ocean. Of the 11 men on board, only Zamperini and two other airmen survived the crash, but help was nowhere to be found, and the men were stranded on a raft together for 47 days. The month and a half at sea proved harrowing for the survivors, as they were subjected to the unrelenting sun, strafing runs by Japanese bombers, circling sharks and little drinking water. To survive, they collected rainwater and killed birds that happened to land on the raft.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">One of the men died at sea before Zamperini and the plane’s pilot, Russell Allen "Phil" Phillips, finally washed ashore. They found themselves on a Pacific island 2,000 miles from the crash site and in enemy Japanese territory. While saved from the ocean, the men were soon taken as prisoners of war by the Japanese, beginning the next leg of their horrific experience.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In captivity across a series of prison camps, Zamperini and Phillips were separated and subjected to torture, both physical and psychological. They were beaten and starved, and Zamperini was singled out and abused repeatedly by a camp sergeant called the Bird, who would tear into fits of psychotic violence. Yet Zamperini, as a former Olympic athlete, was seen as a propaganda tool by the Japanese, a scenario that likely saved him from execution.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The captivity lasted for more than two years, during which time Zamperini was officially pronounced dead by the U.S. military. Zamperini was released only after the war ended in 1945, and he returned to the United States.</p><h2 data-node-id=16 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Postwar Life and Legacy</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Scarred by his ordeal, upon his return home, Zamperini suffered from alcoholism, and he and his wife, Cynthia, came close to divorce. (They stayed married, though, for 54 years, until her death in 2001.) What brought Zamperini back from the brink was hearing a <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/religious-figures/billy-graham data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Billy Graham" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Billy Graham</a> sermon in Los Angeles in 1949, a sermon that inspired Zamperini and began the healing process.</p><img alt="Louis Zamperini 600x487" title="Louis Zamperini 600x487" width=1521 height=1235 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/louis-zamperini-shutterstock_33617857-600x487.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">He went on to found a camp for troubled youth called Victory Boys Camp and forgave his Japanese tormenters. Some received Zamperini’s forgiveness in person in 1950, when he visited a Tokyo prison where they were serving war-crime sentences. In 1998, Zamperini returned to Japan once again to carry the torch at the Nagano Winter Games. He stated his intention to forgive the Bird, Mutsuhiro Watanabe, but Watanabe refused to meet with him.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Zamperini also went on to become a prominent inspirational speaker, and he wrote two memoirs, both titled Devil at My Heels (1956 and 2003). His life has inspired a recent biography as well, Laura Hillenbrand’s Unbroken: A World War II Story of Survival, Resilience, and Redemption. The book has also become the subject of a 2014 film, Unbroken, directed and produced by actress Angelina Jolie, as well as its 2018 sequel Unbroken: Path to Redemption.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Zamperini died at age 97 of pneumonia on July 2, 2014.</p><ul data-node-id=26 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Name: Louis Zamperini</li><li>Birth Year: 1917</li><li>Birth date: January 26, 1917</li><li>Birth State: New York</li><li>Birth City: Olean</li><li>Birth Country: United States</li><li>Gender: Male</li><li>Best Known For: Louis Zamperini was a World War II prisoner of war and an Olympic athlete who became an inspirational figure and writer.</li><li>Industries</li><ul class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>War and Militaries</li><li>Sports</li></ul><li>Astrological Sign: Aquarius</li><li>Schools</li><ul class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>University of Southern California</li><li>Torrance High School</li></ul><li>Nacionalities</li><li>Cultural Associations</li><ul class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Italian American</li></ul><li>Death Year: 2014</li><li>Death date: July 2, 2014</li><li>Death State: California</li><li>Death City: Los Angeles</li><li>Death Country: United States</li></ul><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">We strive for accuracy and fairness.If you see something that doesn't look right,<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/contact-us data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="contact us" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">contact us</a>!</p><br data-node-id=29><ul data-node-id=31 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Article Title: Louis Zamperini Biography</li><li>Author: Biography.com Editors</li><li>Website Name: The Biography.com website</li><li>Url: https://www.biography.com/military-figures/louis-zamperini</li><li>Access Date:</li><li>Publisher: A&amp;E; Television Networks</li><li>Last Updated: October 2, 2020</li><li>Original Published Date: November 11, 2014</li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o7XOoKmaqJiue6S7zGikoqSZqa6zxYyfoKCtoprAcLjOrqCsZaqWurGx0aKlog%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./rhea-perlman.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Rhea Perlman Net Worth - Wiki, Age, Weight and Height, Relationships, Family, and More">&larr;
