His death on Friday, September 1, 2023, sparked a lot of searches relating to him, with people wanting to know about <strong><a href=#>his death</a></strong>, <strong><a href=#>net worth</a></strong>, <strong><a href=#>wife</a></strong>, <strong><a href=#>children</a></strong>, age (75, at the time of death), and more. In this article, we will learn about his parents, María Luisa López-Collada Márquez and William Blaine Richardson Jr.</p><p>The politician and diplomat Bill Richardson passed away on Friday, September 1, 2023. He was known as one of the most effective negotiators for Americans taken hostage abroad.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>He had served as a congressman, a cabinet secretary, and a candidate for president in 2008, but he always went by the nickname “the Governor,” a nod to his tenure as governor of his native New Mexico.</p><p>“Governor Richardson passed away peacefully in his sleep last night,” said Mickey Bergman, vice president of the Richardson Center for Global Engagement, which Richardson ran.</p><p>“He lived his entire life in the service of others – including both his time in government and his subsequent career helping to free people held hostage or wrongfully detained abroad,” Bergman said. “There was no person that Governor Richardson would not speak with if it held the promise of returning a person to freedom. The world has lost a champion for those held unjustly abroad, and I have lost a mentor and a dear friend.”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-bill-richardson-parents-who-were-they><strong>Bill Richardson Parents: Who Were They?</strong></h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>María Luisa López-Collada Márquez and William Blaine Richardson Jr. are Bill Richardson’s parents. He was born in Pasadena, California, USA. William Blaine Richardson Sr. (1891–1972), a Boston-born American bank executive of Anglo-American and Mexican ancestry, worked in Mexico for what is now Citibank.</p><p>Bill Richardson’s mother, Mara Luisa López-Collada Márquez (1914–2011), who was of Mexican descent and was the offspring of a Spanish man from Villaviciosa, Asturias, served as his father’s secretary.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>The father was born on a ship sailing for Nicaragua. Bill Richardson’s father brought his mother to California to give birth just before Bill was born because, as Richardson put it, “My father had a complex about not having been born in the United States.”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>Bill Richardson’s parents made sure he got the best in everything. A native of the United States, he was raised as a Roman Catholic and spent his formative years in an opulent hacienda in Coyoacán’s neighborhood of San Francisco. Bill Richardson’s parents sent him to Middlesex School, a prep school in Concord, Massachusetts, when he was 13 years old. There, he played baseball as a pitcher. He started attending Tufts University in 1966 and played baseball there as well.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Richardson majored in French and political science while obtaining his Bachelor’s degree from Tufts University in 1970. He also served as president of the fraternity Delta Tau Delta.</p><p>In 1971, he graduated with a master’s degree in international affairs from the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University. In Concord, Massachusetts, where they both attended high school, he first met his future wife, Barbara, with whom he later got married in 1972 after she completed her studies at Wheaton College. William Brewster, a traveler aboard the Mayflower, was an ancestor of Richardson.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-bill-richardson-career><strong>Bill Richardson Career</strong></h2><p>Bill Richardson’s parents may not have seen his success, but the late politician did make his parents very proud. After graduating from college, Richardson worked for Massachusetts-based Republican Congressman F. Bradford Morse. Later, he worked for the Senate Foreign Relations Committee as staff. During the Nixon administration, Richardson worked on congressional relations for the Henry Kissinger State Department.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Bill Richardson served as the 30th governor of New Mexico from 2003 to 2011. He served as the United States’ ambassador to the UN, the Clinton administration’s energy secretary, a member of Congress, the chairman of the 2004 Democratic National Convention, and the head of the Democratic Governors Association.</p><ul class=td-pulldown-filter-list></ul><a class="td-social-sharing-button td-social-handler td-social-expand-tabs" href=# data-block-uid=tdi_37 title=More><i class="td-icon-plus td-social-expand-tabs-icon"></i></a><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><span style=border-color:#0a0a0a;border-width:1px;width:100%></span><span style=border-color:#0a0a0a;border-width:1px;width:100%></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTBmqqeZpOkunCuyKWjZqqZmLWivsOspqdloJa%2FprrTrGSmmaKerm641KKqmmWcpL2mxoycpqWkkZmubrnAq6iunapirq%2BwjLCgpaSZlrpursuaoKedXae2pLTAq5usp55it7N7</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./eddie-murphys-net-worth-salary-real-estate-investments-biography-and-more.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Eddie Murphys net worth, salary, Real Estate ,Investments, Biography and more">&larr;
