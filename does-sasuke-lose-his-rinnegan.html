Anyways, Sasuke can't unlock another rinnegan. He already has hashirama's cells(which has ashura's chakra) within his body and nothing has happened.<h2>Does Sasuke will get his Rinnegan back?</h2>Sasuke does not get his rinnegan back. If he gets his Rinnegan back, he would boost his current power level, however, this will not happen as now he is not the protagonist of the show. It is said that the powers and all the Uchiha abilities come from Shinobi's blood.<h2>Does Sasuke lose his Rinnegan in Boruto?</h2>“During that recent battle, I lost the Rinnegan, a big source of power for me,” Sasuke explained to his daughter, Sarada, in Boruto: Next Generation, episode 222.<h2>Is Sasuke weak after losing Rinnegan?</h2>Unfortunately, both Naruto Uzumaki and Sasuke Uchiha were severely weakened in the fight against Isshiki in Boruto and the latter ended up losing his Rinnegan. Nonetheless, Sasuke still has countless impressive abilities up his sleeve.<h2>Sasuke Loses his Rinnegan (4K Ultra HD) | Boruto attacks Naruto and Sasuke</h2><p></p><h2>Is Sasuke's Rinnegan permanent?</h2>Unlike Sharingan, Sasuke's Rinnegan is permanently active and is unable to revert to its original state. The Rinnegan is reputed as the most exalted eye amongst the “Three Great Dojutsu”, the others being the Sharingan and the Byakugan.<h2>Is Sasuke blind in Boruto?</h2>Through the power of medical ninjutsu, Sasuke has an eye transplant,and is cured from the blindness while developing his new Eternal Mangekyou Sharingan.<h2>Can Sasuke get a second Rinnegan?</h2>If you are asking if Sasuke would get another rinnegan if he would receive an arm from Hashirama's cell, the answer would still be no. Sasuke already has Hashirama's cells from Kabuto (from the war) and despite maybe a (Wrong) popular opinion, Hagoromo didn't directly "give" Sasuke the rinnegan himself.<h2>Who stole Sasuke's Rinnegan?</h2>Sasuke Uchiha lost his Rinnegan to Momoshiki Otsutsuki shortly after Naruto's fight against Isshiki Otsutsuki concluded. Just as everything appeared to be done, Momoshiki Otsutsuki took control of Boruto's body, took Sasuke by surprise, and stabbed his eye with a kunai.<h2>Can Naruto heal Sasuke Rinnegan?</h2>Naruto in the sage of six paths mode can heal others (stabilized Guy's life force, resuscitated Obito Uchiha after having the Ten Tails ripped out of his body and restored Kakashi's left eye) so he can restore Sasuke's eye, if not the rinnegan then at least the sharingan.....<h2>Will sarada get Rinnegan?</h2>If she has both the chakra, then yes, Rinnegan will be activated.<h2>Why did Boruto stab Sasuke eye?</h2>According to Comic Book, in chapter 54 of Boruto, Boruto stabs Sasuke in his left eye because he was being controlled by Momoshiki Ōtsutsuki. Momoshiki was a member of the Ōtsutsuki Clan's main family of otherworldly beings.<h2>Can Sasuke use Susanoo with one eye?</h2>One of the reasons is that, in Naruto, they witnessed Uchiha Shisui use his Susanoo with just one eye after Danzo stole the other. Since the remaining Sharingan that Sasuke has is an Eternal Mangekyo Sharingan, not to mention he still has his Indra Chakra, it does not seem impossible for him to use it with one eye.<h2>Who is Ryuto Uzumaki?</h2>Ryuto Uzumaki is a shinobi of Konohagakure. He was given chakra of the Nine-Tails on the day of his birth a fate that caused him to be ostracised by most of Konoha throughout his childhood. After joining Team 10 Ryuto worked hard to gain the village's acknowledgement all the while chasing his dream to become Hokage.<h2>Will Naruto get Rinnegan?</h2>No. He needs to have Indra chakra in himself to get the Rinnegan too. So he needs to take blood or something else from Sasuke. But his getting rinnegan is unlikely, as he gets body related powers where Sasuke gets the eyes.<h2>Can Naruto get Kurama back?</h2>They will always come back, but until that happens, they're factually dead. So, deliberately creating some new Tailed-beasts to get Kurama back does not seem like something Naruto would do. Even if he technically can with his Sage of Six Paths powers, or so the fandom seems to think.<h2>What happens after Boruto stabs Sasuke's Rinnegan?</h2>In the chapter, fans will see that Sasuke who was stabbed in the eye by Boruto will lose his power. In the previous chapter, Momoshiki took control of Boruto and used him to stab Sasuke in his left-eye that has Rinnegan. Now, it is revealed in the new chapter that Sasuke can't use his Rinnegan anymore.<h2>Will Kurama come back to life?</h2>Will Kurama Come Back to Life? Sadly, there's no hint of Kurama coming back to life in the Boruto manga series when writing this post. So, it's safe to say that's how things will stay in the anime as well. In the manga, Kurama died in chapter 55, and episode 219 adapted 11 pages from the same chapter.<h2>Did Boruto become evil?</h2>It seems unlikely that Boruto will turn into a villain, at least by his own accord. However, the presence of the karma seal indicates that there is a possibility that Momoshiki Otsutsuki has possessed Boruto to go on a rampage that devastates the shinobi world.<h2>Who has the strongest Rinnegan?</h2>The Sage of Six Paths, Hagoromo Otsutsuki was certainly the strongest of all the Rinnegan users in Naruto. Unlike the other Rinnegan which are Kekkei Genkai, his was considered to be a Kekkei Mora, meaning its powers surpassed a regular Rinnegan.<h2>Who has Rinne Sharingan?</h2>Kaguya awakens the Rinne Sharingan. This dōjutsu was first manifested by Kaguya Ōtsutsuki as a third eye on her forehead after eating the chakra fruit of the God Tree. It was also possessed by the Ten-Tails, the result of Kaguya merging with the God Tree.<h2>Does Sasuke get a new arm in Boruto?</h2>Sasuke never replaced his left arm, lost during the Fourth Shinobi World War. Instead, he began to use his katana more and perfect his other techniques. It was a reminder of how much he needed to atone for attacking Konoha.<h2>Why did Kakashi not go blind?</h2>TLDR: The known users of MS could use the individual techniques a lot of times. Itachi mostly used individual techniques. Sasuke relied more on Susanoo. Kakashi needed to properly awaken MS to use it efficiently, and even so lost his sight at no greater amount of uses than Itachi.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrTnqmvoZWsrrOxwGeaqKVfm66ye8OonKxlo5bAtrfEZqOoq5Vitaq%2FjKugp6aVnK6v</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./amds-2016-gpu-roadmap-finfet-high-bandwidth-memory.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="FinFET &amp;amp; High Bandwidth Memory">&larr;
