Cody Simpson, who recently ended his relationship with Miley Cyrus, appeared to go out to lunch with some friends. During the lunch, one stunning blonde was photographed not only holding Cody’s hand but also kissing his cheeks. They were following each other on Instagram, according to some research.</p><p>However, neither Cody nor Marloes confirmed their relationship status at the time. Finally, in December 2020, the romance was confirmed. Cody Simpson’s mother, Angie Simpson, shared a photo of the model and the singer looking cozy during the family’s holiday celebration.</p><p>Marloes previously dated fellow model Clark Bockelman before meeting Cody Simpson. Clark Bockelman is well-known for his Wilhelmina portraits. He had previously modeled for major brands such as Calvin Klein.</p><p>It was unknown when Clark and Marloes began or ended their relationship. However, they began dating around the year 2013.
