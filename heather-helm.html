A basic rule of thumb is that a real estate agent must sell $50 million in homes in order to earn $1 million per year.</p><p>Her husband Matthew, on the other hand, earns a solid living from his profession. Her spouse Matthew Lillard’s net worth is reported to be approximately $2 million. We have no doubt that he leads a very pleasant and lavish life. Certainly, the couple and their children live a pretty affluent lifestyle.</p><h2><span id=Heather_and_Matthew8217s_First_Date>Heather and Matthew’s First Date</span></h2><p>At a gathering, Heather and Matthew met for the first time. According to sources, Matthew fell head over heels for Heather right away. Soon after, Helm announced her plans to attend a friend’s wedding in Italy, and he invited himself. Their romantic relationship began at that time and is currently ongoing.</p><h2><span id=Heather_Helm8217s_Married_Life_with_Husband_Matthew_Lillard>Heather Helm’s Married Life with Husband Matthew Lillard</span></h2><p>Heather Helm married her lover Matthew Lillard in 1998 after they first met.

The family has been living a nice life with a strong bond. Heather lives in Pasadena with her husband Matthew.</p><h2><span id=Heather_Helm_Is_She_a_Lesbian>Heather Helm, Is She a Lesbian?</span></h2><p>Heather Helm and her husband have been living a happy married life. As a result, her sexual orientation is heterosexual. Likewise, there is no evidence that she is a lesbian. But she has been married to her husband for a long time. There has been no report of either of them cheating on each other because they are the same gender.</p><p>The pair adores one other and is heterosexual in sexual orientation. So we may conclude that her sexual orientation is straight and that the stories about her are false.</p><h2><span id=Job_as_a_Realtor_Heather_Helmett>Job as a Realtor Heather Helmett</span></h2><p>Despite the fact that she is not as well-known as her spouse.
