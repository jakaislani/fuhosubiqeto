It is based on a memoir by his wife Deborah (played by <a href=#>Samantha Morton</a>), a teenager when they married, and directed by the photographer <a href=#>Anton Corbijn</a>, whose early photos helped establish Curtis' image as young, handsome and sorrowful. The title of Deborah's book, <i>Touching From a Distance,</i> could describe all his relationships.</p><p>There is irony in the band name Joy Division, because Ian seems to experience little joy and much inner division, as an almost passive participant in his own career. Listen to the two albums the band made, and you hear his lead vocals as relentless complaints against --what? The melancholy that prevents him from feeling the emotions expressed by his words?</p><p>The movie is quietly, superbly photographed and acted. It is in black and white and gray, of course, and we sense Ian was a man who dreamed in shadows, not colors. He is played by <a href=#>Sam Riley</a>, who makes him seem always alone. There is a lot of performance footage, but Riley sees Ian not so much performing as functioning. His bandmates sometimes look at him with that inward expression people get when they wonder if they have enough gas to get to the next gas station.</p><p>Ian's marriage is, of course, a focus of the film, since his wife was not only its source and co-writer but co-producer. He was clearly not ready for marriage. She was younger but more balanced and competent. Ian had an affair with Annik Honore (<a href=#>Alexandra </a><a href=#>Maria Lara</a>), a Belgian, and the movie deals with that straight on, not painting her as a homewrecker but as another of the enablers Ian used. For him, I suspect, love meant not so much what he felt for a woman as what she felt for him.</p><p>Early in the film, Ian and Deborah attend a Sex Pistols concert, and Ian has his ideas altered about what a band is and what music is. His stage style with a microphone resembles a shy, introverted Johnny Rotten. We meet key players in the pivotal Manchester music scene of the period, including the entrepreneur Tony Wilson (<a href=#>Craig Parkinson</a>), immortalized in Michael Winterbottom's "<a href=#>24 Hour Party People</a>," a film about the same time and place.</p><p>Ian Curtis suffered from epilepsy, a condition which I'm not sure he fully understood. It seems to have come upon him around 20, and sometimes during a stage performance, we see him moving spasmodically and wonder if performing triggers episodes. Unlike epilepsy as experienced by, say, Unlike epilepsy as experienced by, say, Prince Myshkin in Doystoyevskiâ€™s "The Idiot," Ian's does not seem to involve a transition through an ecstatic state. He grows agitated, blanks out, regains consciousness, is confused and depressed. His body has betrayed him.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46cpqesoqS5bn6PaW4%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./kristen-bells-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Kristen Bells Net Worth : Books &amp;amp; Career">&larr;
